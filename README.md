# PS2 3D Demo

By [Alberto Fustinoni](http://aftnet.net)

This is a tech demo of PS2 3D programming using the Vector Units for transform and lighting (per vertex Blinn-Phong model).

[Dr. Henry S. Fortuna](http://www.abertay.ac.uk/Research/Staff/H_Fortuna/)'s framework has been extended to account for 3 directional light sources in addition to the ambient component and allow model loading from binary .ms3d Milkshape 3D files.

## Controls
Use the analog sticks to move and rotate the camera

## System Requirements
A properly configured PS2 with Linux kit
